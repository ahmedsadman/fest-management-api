# Festive
A REST API created using Flask to manage university fests of mid to large scale. Every year (if not months), different universitities around the world organize different kinds of fests where students can attend on. These fests include competitions like Hackathons, Math Olympiad, Programming Competition, Robotics and many more. Often they need some kind of web/mobile platform to arrange such events. This is where this API comes into play. The organizers can create mobile/web application without worrying about the backend.

## Features
- Participant Registration
- Event Management
- Payment tracking
- Basic statistics
- Full-fledged participants/events search based on customized queries

## Usage
This is not meant to be used as SaaS (Software as a service). You have to manage this API on your own. Knowledge of Python/Flask is a pre-requisite. You have to fork/clone this repo and host this API in your own server as needed. Based on your needs, you might need to do small to large modifications in the code.

## Documentation
The documentation is still incomplete (75% complete). A partial documentation can be found in [Postman Festive Docs](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/4839696/SVfNwpxe). I didn't have much time to document the API. But surely I will come back to it at some point. _If you're interested for documenting the API, please create an issue so that I can help you further._

## Development
This is an active project and more features will be added to it later. But this is stable enough to deploy right away. 

## Contributions
Feel free to contribute to this project. Please remember a proper documentation of the API is first priority. So if you want to help with that, you're much welcome
